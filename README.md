# ReactAuthDemo

This is a simple demo app that shows how to use authentication in a React application with an ASP.Net core backend.

## Setup Instructions

In your **data** project, add a reference to `BCrypt.Net-Next`. You can either do it through the Nuget UI:

or, you can add the following line to your `<ItemGroup>` section of your `.csproj` file:

```
<PackageReference Include="BCrypt.Net-Next" Version="4.0.3" />
```

Then, add the following lines of code to your `Program.cs` file within the **web** project:
